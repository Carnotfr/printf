Printf Repository Description
This GitHub repository, named "printf," is dedicated to the development of a custom printf function in the C programming language. The printf function in C is a powerful tool for formatting and printing text to the standard output stream, and this project aims to create a simplified version of it while also adding some custom features.

Overview (README.md)
Introduction
The printf function in C is a fundamental tool for displaying formatted text to the standard output. This project implements a custom version of printf with some additional features. The primary goal is to provide a simplified printf function capable of handling specific conversion specifiers while also incorporating unique custom specifiers.

Features
Basic Specifiers: The core functionality of printf is covered, including the conversion specifiers %c, %s, and %%. These allow the printing of characters, strings, and literal percent signs, respectively.

Integer Specifiers: The project extends the functionality to include the conversion specifiers %d and %i for printing integers.

Binary Specifier: A custom specifier %b is added to convert and print integers in binary format.

Unsigned Integer Specifiers: The conversion specifiers %u, %o, %x, and %X are supported for printing unsigned integers in various formats.

String Specifier: A custom specifier %S is implemented, which prints strings while handling non-printable characters by displaying their ASCII values in hexadecimal format.

Pointer Specifier: The %p specifier is supported for printing memory addresses.

Flag Characters: Flag characters like +, space, and # are implemented for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Length Modifiers: The project supports length modifiers l and h for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Field Width: Field width can be specified for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Precision: Precision can be specified for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Zero Flag Character: The 0 flag character is supported for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Minus Flag Character: The - flag character is supported for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Custom Specifiers: Custom specifiers %r and %R are added to print reversed strings and ROT13-encoded strings, respectively.

Usage
To use this custom printf function in your C code, include the appropriate header file and call _printf with the desired format string and arguments.

Example:

#include "printf.h"

int main(void) {
    _printf("%d\n", 42); // Prints an integer
    _printf("%S\n", "Hello\nWorld"); // Prints a string with non-printable characters
    return (0);
}

Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

printf.h and printf.c: Header and source files containing the implementation of the custom printf function.

main.c: An example usage of the custom printf function with various format specifiers.
